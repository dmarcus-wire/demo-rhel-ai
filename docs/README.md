# Overview of SKills and Knowledge

You can use skill and knowledge sets and specify domain-specific information to teach your custom model.

Knowledge
A dataset that consists of background information and facts. 

Skills
A dataset where you can teach the model how to do a task.
1.  Compositional skills allow AI models to perform specific tasks or functions.
    a. Freeform compositional skills: These are performative skills that to not require additional context or information to function.
    b. Grounded compositional skills: These are performative skills that require additional context. For example, you can teach the model to read a table, where the additional context is an example of the table layout.
2. Foundational skills are skills that involve math, reasoning, and coding.
